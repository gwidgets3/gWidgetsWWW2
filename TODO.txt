* Why is this causing loadMethods error:

##' @import methods
NA

##' A class.
A <- setRefClass("A",
                 methods=list(
                   initialize = function(...) {
                     callSuper(...)
#                     initFields(... )
                   }
                   ))


##' B class
B <- setRefClass("B",
                 fields=list(
                   "test"="A"
                   ),
                 methods=list(
                   initialize=function(...) {
                     test <<- A$new()
                     callSuper(...)
                   }
                   ))
